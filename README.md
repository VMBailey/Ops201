# Ops 201 README

Hey there! Welcome to my first repository from my time at Code Fellows. This repo is a collection of scripts that we developed in order to further our skills in cybersecurity.

During that time, we learned PowerShell, Bash, and Shell scripting. I'm learning these skills in order to make myself invaluable to any team. Ultimately, my goal is to use these skills in order to protect others from malicious cyber attacks and these scripts are just the beginning.

One of my favorites, AutomatedEndpointConfigurations, will enable and disable certain features in Windows 10. If this script were to be pushed to a netowrk of Windows machines on the same network, they will all have the same configurations thanks to this script. I look forwardto expanding on this script as this will be crucial to keeping things running smoothly in a work environment.
